# stic-webmaster-backend-intro

A few files to introduce the concept of backend vs frontend dynamic pages.

To view the php pages you either need to copy this folder in your local
webserver folder (e.g. www for Apache) or lauch a server using the php -S
localhost:9000 command if you have php globally installed in your system.
